`*Note : Because of infinite scrolling , page loads when user scrolls bottom . Now as the scroll continues , more pages will load and when there is no more page to load , The app will show no more items . [In our case the app will stop loading after page2 as there is no further data on any page . So I have used infinite scrolling but data is not soo large in our case]`
